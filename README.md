# Advent of Code 2025

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem-solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## How It Works

Each day from December 1st through December 25th, a new two-part puzzle is released at midnight EST/UTC-5. The puzzles are designed to be solved in order, with each day building on concepts from previous days.

- **Part 1**: Usually introduces the core problem and concepts
- **Part 2**: Often adds a twist or increases complexity
